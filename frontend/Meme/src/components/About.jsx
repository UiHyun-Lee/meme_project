      <p>
        Welcome to The Meme Arena – where humans and AIs clash in the ultimate battle of humor!
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a student-led research team at the Human-Consistent Interaction group, turning meme culture into serious science (with a view). Our goal is to explore creativity at the intersection of human and artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your participation helps build AI models that understand something as nuanced as meme-making. So if you've ever thought, "We could do better" – here we are, building an open platform where anyone can prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is part of a Bachelor thesis project exploring humor, co-creativity, and the cultural role of memes. Users can submit their own memes, vote in head-to-head battles, and even generate memes with cutting-edge AI. Every vote contributes to our study, helping us answer: who makes the better meme – people or machines?
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a meme connoisseur, an AI enthusiast, or just here for the laughs, you're part of the experiment. Let the meme battle begin.
